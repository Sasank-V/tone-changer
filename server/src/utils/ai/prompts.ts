IMPORTANT: You have previously generated these versions, so please create a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT rewrite that avoids repeating the same words, phrases, or sentence structures:

Previous attempts to avoid:
${previousAttempts

Requirements for this new attempt:
- Use different vocabulary and word choices than the previous attempts
- Employ different sentence structures and lengths
- Approach the ${tonesDescription} tone from a fresh angle
- Maintain the same core meaning as the original text
- Be creative and find new ways to express the message
- If previous attempts were longer, try a different length approach
- If previous attempts used specific phrases, avoid those exact phrases

Original text to rewrite: "${originalText}"

Generate a fresh, creative rewrite that feels distinctly different from the previous attempts while still achieving the ${tonesDescription} tone.`;
